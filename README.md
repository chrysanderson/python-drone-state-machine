# Drone State Machine

## Project Description
This project is a Python program that simulates the flight of a drone using a Finite State Machine. The user can interact with the drone via the command line, transitioning it between different states like 'ready', 'taking off', 'hovering', and 'landing'.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Finite State Machines:** Building a robust program structure based on discrete states and transitions.
* **Control Flow:** Advanced use of `while` loops and `if/elif` statements to manage program logic.
* **Simulations:** Using the `time` module to create a simple, realistic simulation of a real-world system.
* **User Interaction:** Taking and processing command-line input from a user.
* **Modular Design:** Structuring a program to be clear, readable, and easy to expand.

## How to Run the Project
1.  Ensure you have the `drone.py` file on your computer.
2.  Open your terminal in the same directory as the file.
3.  Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python drone.py
    ```
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to control the drone's flight.
